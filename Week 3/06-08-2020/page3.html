                    <p>The last time a temple existed in Ayodhya, Krishnadevaraya was emperor in the South ruling over the Vijayanagara empire, Nuno da Cunha was governor of Portuguese India, Spanish conquistadors were setting foot in Texas, and Suleiman the Magnificent was inaugurating the era of Ottoman supremacy in West Asia. With the bhoomi pujan on August 5, the long saga of struggle of a people has come to an end. This day falls on the first anniversary of the full constitutional integration of Jammu and Kashmir to India, making it a symbolic date in post-colonial India. This is the twilight of the first Republic.</p><br>
                    <p>Hindutva is not Hinduism. Hindutva is a Hindu political response to political Islam and Western imperialism. It seeks to forge Hindus into a modern nation and create a powerful industrial State that can put an end to centuries of persecution that accelerated sharply over the past 100 years when the Hindu-Sikh presence was expunged in large swaths of the Indian subcontinent.

                        India’s freedom struggle was guided by the vision of Hindu nationalism and not by constitutional patriotism. The Congress brand of nationalism was but a subset of this broader Hindu nationalism with the Congress itself as the pre-eminent Hindu party. The Muslim question forced the Congress to adopt a more tempered language and symbolism later and to weave the myth of Hindu-Muslim unity. But it failed to prevent the Partition of India. The Congress was taken over by Left-leaning secular denialists under Jawaharlal Nehru who, instead of confronting reality, pretended it did not exist.</p>

                    <p>On August 5 and 6 last year, the Narendra Modi administration took two steps that fundamentally altered the lives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). First, it removed the special status that the state enjoyed in the Indian Union under Article 370 of the Constitution. Then, Parliament enacted the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which demoted and divided the state into two Union territories.

                        To ensure that there was no protest against these steps, the Modi administration arrested all the state’s political leaders the day before, except those belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), imposed Section 144, and snapped all communications in and with the state.</p>
                    <p>The BJP claimed these measures would improve security, and give the people of J&K the same rights as prevailed in the rest of India. One year has passed. How do we assess those claims? Take security first. There has been a sharp rise in insecurity on the borders, but some improvement internally. We are still struggling to reverse the Chinese incursions into Ladakh, and cross-border firing by Pakistan has risen sharply. Internally, however, there has been a drop of around 30% in casualties comparing August 2019-July 2020 with the same period in the preceding year. But we also find a rising trend in casualties from April 2020, which is worrying. The reduction in casualties was achieved at considerable human cost. According to figures given by the J&K administration, this came at the cost of the detention of 6,600 people — including children — under the draconian Public Safety Act, the continuous imposition of Section 144 to date, the restriction of mobile telephony and Internet to 2G services, and a new media policy that allows security agencies to censor media outlets.</p>

                    <p>Camera-traps used in the last tiger census (2018) captured the presence of more free-ranging domestic dogs than tigers in 17 tiger reserves, according to a report in The Indian Express. There is also a substantial presence of both dogs and livestock in at least 30 tiger reserves, the report added. The presence of feral and abandoned dogs and livestock in forests, say experts, could lead to the transmission of diseases to wild animals. These stray animals also compete with wild animals for resources, affecting their foraging patterns. The National Tiger Conservation Authority has said that livestock and dogs are found in fringe areas of forests close to villages.</p>
                    <p>While the camera-trap capture has provided real-time evidence now, this problem has been growing for years. India has about five million stray cattle, thanks to rural distress and fodder shortage (both make livestock maintenance expensive), lack of the adequate number of shelters, increase in peri-urban dairies, and a ban on cattle slaughter in many states. The feral dog population is 60 million because of the breakdown of the animal birth control (ABC) programme, increasing cases of abandonment of dogs, and the lack of adequate waste management and requisite number of shelters. A 2018 research by ATREE found that free-ranging dogs attacked 80 species of wildlife between 2015 and 2016, mostly mammals.

                        The problem of stray animals is not just in forests, but also in Indian cities. Instead of endless debates on whether it’s right to feed dogs or not, citizens must demand answers on the operational record of the Animal Welfare Board of India, why governments have reduced funding and support to the ABC programme and failed to untangle the problem of multiplicity of authorities and build shelters.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The pell-mell in the Congress’ legislative arm in Rajasthan has again brought into focus the vulnerabilities of the anti-defection law. There have been suggestions that the 1985 amendment, which inducted the 10th Schedule in the Constitution, has ceased to be the antidote to the malaise for which it was designed. The past decades have seen numerous circumventions of its provisions to topple regimes through desertions from elected legislatures.

                    As opposed to copybook defections — which are punishable with the loss of House membership — desertions have become the norm. Riding allegedly on the exchange of monies and promises of official positions, they are typified by resignations to bring down the effective strength of the House. That gives ascendance to parties with the wherewithal to lure turncoats.
                    
                    The slipway serves well the legislators willing to be poached. It saves them the ignominy of being divested of membership which inevitably would be their fate for defying the party whip under the 10th Schedule. Such desertions-resignations are also useful because there’s no bar on the deserters returning to the same legislature in the bypolls to vacancies caused by their exit.</p>
                    <p>
                        Such manoeuvrings can only be stalled legislatively. If the stakeholders, especially political parties represented in Parliament, are serious about stemming the rot, they should bring about a consensual amendment to the law to block all routes for the renegade members’ re-election to the same House. A six-year time-bar for contesting elections, as is the case with those guilty of corrupt electoral practices, could be a good deterrent to end circuitous horse-trading.

                        The proffered moratorium may appear too harsh. But it won’t be disproportionate to the magnitude of the offence. Ethically speaking, defections aren’t merely a betrayal of a party or an ideology. They’re a breach of the people’s trust which should be inviolable when the poll-time promise, or pretence, is to serve the electorate.

                        If allowed unhindered, the frequent hijacking of popular mandates could denude our multi-party democracy of its representative character and credibility. The act of the big fish gobbling up the small fish might ensure durable regimes, but not necessarily a diverse society predicated on variegated thought and aspirations. In addition to bolstering the anti-defection law, it will be in order also to read down the omnibus party whips to allow intra-party disagreements on matters other than votes impinging on the viability of regimes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A compact where justice belongs to the stronger is antithetical to all principles of democratic equity. It’s true especially of states with small, easy-to-fracture legislatures. Their record of aaya ram, gaya rams makes them easily malleable entities where tail wags the dog. The point is proved by past instances of defections/desertions in the Northeast, Goa and Haryana. A prime example of it perhaps is the 2006 elevation of an independent legislator, Madhu Koda, as the chief minister of Jharkhand.
                        The tenuous legislative construct of small assemblies is compounded by the preponderance of minuscule parties/pressure groups canvassing ethnic, socio-cultural and sub-regional aspirations. Their obliteration at the altar of political expediency involves the risk of communities losing their voice, getting alienated and dropping out of the national mainstream.

                        In the unitary versus federal tussle, the winner has to be decentralisation of power. A key achievement of the coalition era (1989-2014) at the Centre was the regional parties’ share in governance that helped subdue sub-nationalist, separatist and secessionist tendencies. A testimony to that is the relative peace in the Northeast, Tamil Nadu and Punjab which saw violent movements threatening the country’s integrity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The anti-defection law, as it exists today, permits legislators with two-third strength of their legislature party to break free without losing memberships. It’s this leeway that’s exploited to alter the House arithmetic by balkanising smaller political outfits. The Constitution’s 10th Schedule says: “...the merger of the original political party of a member of a House shall be deemed to have taken place if, and only if, not less than two-thirds of the members of the legislature party concerned have agreed to such merger.” The Schedule’s Para 4 (2) relating to exemption from disqualification only mentions the legislative wing, not the party organisation as a whole.

                        In Rajasthan, the Bahujan Samaj Party has challenged in the high court the “merger” with the Congress of its six legislators constituting more than two-thirds of the party’s strength in the House. It’s for the judiciary now to apply the ratio of the 10th schedule to decide the case — the next hearing of which is scheduled for August 11.

                        Regardless of the court verdict, Parliament must do its bit to buttress the law. For a democracy without Opposition is but a part democracy without choices.
