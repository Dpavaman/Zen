                    <P style="color: #321637; line-height: 1; text-align: justify;">There’s more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than
                        focusing on block style information architecture, you can create
                        refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful
                        photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users.</P>

                        <p style="color: white; text-align: right;">Do you want to tell a story with your product or service?
                            Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and
                            encourages meaningful interaction from users.</p>

                        <p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It’s
                            now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping.
                            Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
                            providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</p>

                        <p style="color: white; direction: rtl; text-align: justify;">Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
                            website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their
                            message and vision into one dynamic web design page.</p>

                            REALISE THEIR GOAL </h1>
                        <p style="color: black; text-align: left;">These days, scrolling is so simple that it’s become an
                            instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page
                            requires thought and motivation. A single page website
                            allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker,
                            than needing to sift through multiple pages.</p>

                        <h2 class="tex-subheads" style="color: pink;">YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</h2>
                        <p style="color: pink;">One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
                            they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of
                            pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and
                            negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results
                            page (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-heads" style="color: white;">SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h1>
                        <p style="color: white;">50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn’t loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the
                            more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to
                            load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax
                            websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to
                            load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites
                            loaded within a few seconds. </p>

                        <h1 class="text-heads" style="color: black;">AWKWARD NAVIGATION</h1>
                        <p style="color: black; text-align: right;">nstead of hitting the “back” button, users must scroll back
                            up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to
                            refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is
                            to include top navigation and have each element anchored
                            to a category or section. </p>
